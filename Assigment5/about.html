                    <h1>The Bake & Butter Story</h1><br/><br/>
                    <p>The story of this famous bakery begins in 2001 on a quaint, cobblestone corner in the West Village where Bake & Butter opened its doors for the first time. The sweet smell of cakes and cookies and pies and pudding tumbled out, wafting down the streets, beckoning all in.

                        Our red velvet cupcakes became iconic. Bake & Butter was a destination for locals and tourists alike.
                        
                        We wrote cookbooks and helped people all over celebrate their most important moments.
                        
                        And while we have grown, a few things will always remain: open early and close late, a dollop of buttercream makes everything better, and our mission: make today sweeter than yesterday. </p>
